    Embassies i was given the permit to join my wife in Austria ..Upon arrival here i did some deutschkurs (though am still really bad at it)and stayed home for 2 years 
    with the hopes of being enroll in a school to further my education but it never happened due to mistrust from my ex.So i finally found me a work in 2015 through the benevolent 
    from a friend .My then wife started making problems with me to the extent that sometimes i was asked to move out of the house.so finally in May that year i was given an order of separation 
    and i moved out of the house ..And in 2016 we decided to finally divorce .i now have 1 kid from my last relationship calle Mia Dufie .i named her after my mum.
